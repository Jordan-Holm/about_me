        <p>
            Dear Review Committee,
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thrilled to be back before you today, eager to present my portfolio for consideration in the 3D Game Development cohort. Having previously applied in the spring of 2022, I took that time to reflect, refocus, and make significant strides in both my academic and professional journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon facing a challenging semester, I recognized the importance of strengthening my skills to align more closely with the demands of the dynamic field of game development. To address this, I undertook a comprehensive web development bootcamp at Dev Point Labs, not only honing my coding abilities but also gaining valuable insights into the interconnected nature of technology in today's industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to share that not only did I successfully complete the web development program, but I also transitioned into a role as a teacher's assistant at the bootcamp for the following spring semester. This experience not only solidified my understanding of the subjects but also allowed me to contribute to the growth of fellow learners, reinforcing my commitment to continuous improvement and collaborative learning environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to UVU with renewed focus and determination, I am currently maintaining strong grades, a testament to my dedication to academic excellence. My journey over the past year has been transformative, equipping me with a more comprehensive skill set and a deeper understanding of the industry's demands.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you explore my portfolio, I hope you'll witness not just the evolution of my technical abilities but also a passion for creating immersive and engaging experiences within the realm of 3D game development. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to and thriving in the vibrant community that defines the 3D Game Development cohort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to discussing my portfolio in further detail.
            <br />Sincerely,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan
